## Introduction

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, brought significant enhancements to the JavaScript language, introducing new syntax and features to make code more readable and maintainable. This project aims to provide a concise overview of these features, making it a valuable resource for developers transitioning to ES6.

## Features Covered

- let and const: Block-scoped variable declarations.
- Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing functions.
- Template Literals: Enhanced string interpolation.
- Destructuring Assignment: Extracting values from arrays or objects.
- Default Parameters: Providing default values for function parameters.
- Rest and Spread Operators: Handling variable numbers of arguments.
- Classes: A more convenient way to define constructor functions and prototypes.
- Modules: A standardized way to organize and structure code.
- Promises: Simplifying asynchronous code with a more flexible pattern.
